"home" : 
	- A place where [I can] [poop] for however long I [desire].
	- [harry styles]
	- A word that means something different to each person who uses it.  A person's home can be the place where they live, the place they grew up, or the place where the people they care about live.  In the case of some people, home is a [variable] concept, changing [dependant] on the [placement] of another person or object, or a person may even consider his or her own body the only 'true' home.
	- Where [dreams] [go to] [die].
	- [that place] where you feel unjudged, loved and safe -- no matter [how you] act [or what] you do.
	- A place that you feel [comfortable] in. Usually a home has family, friends, and whatever makes that person happy.  A house isn't [necessarily] a home if there are [no friends], school, job, etc. that makes the individual happy.
	- home is wherever [i'm with you].
	- In relationships, "getting home" is to have sex with the other person.
(as an [analogy] of beisball, the different [steps] from kissing to actually having sex, have been compared to getting 1st,2nd [3rd base], and finally "getting home")
	- What a [house] becomes [after the] person [owning] it has had sex in every room.
	- [The place] where you feel most [at ease] whether [your family] is there or not

----------------------------
"school" : 
	- a place you go to spend [70]% of your day sitting in an uncomfortable, [plastic] [chair]
	- The mandatory hellhole where you're forced to go for 14 years. Often full of teachers that bore you out of your mind and [bombard] you with this useless crap you will never need (such as the dreaded things called homework or coursework), bratty wannabe gangstas who think they rule the world, dog-shit cafeteria food that moves, and [a fuckton] of other things that make it seem like somebody decided to put education, hell, and prison all in a blender and then the result is these compulsory things called "schools".

If you think that you couldn't learn anything without the help of compulsory school, maybe you never thought of alternatives. And free education? I spend 100-200 on school crap each year, so don't bombard me with that chestnut. And the next person to mention [flipping burgers] can hop on the school bus and go to hell.
	- Where we waste [18 years] [of life] at.

[nuff said]
	- An institution originally noncompulsory, now a forced hellhole where otherwise reasonably intelligent people are forced to go for 14 years.

It instills in them a great hatred of what they otherwise would not despise; for example, many children who hate history don't actually hate the Civil War. They just hate that they're being forced to memorize names and dates. If they were left to their own devices, they would probably end up knowing the basics about the Civil War without having to spend pointless hours proving to some mindless beaurocrat that they know what they're talking about.

An institution that takes too long to not do enough. An institution that makes people believe that it is the only way anyone will ever learn anything or meet anyone. Apparently the real world and libraries and the Internet are [not valid] places of learning or places to socialize. Nope, you have to go with all the other inmates in an environment where you get no respect at all from [dipshits] with a special piece of paper that says they know how to humiliate you.

[Pavlov's] dogs, but teenagers.

A place where they're so freaking retarded they can't just make school noncompulsory. If it were noncompulsory, after a while everyone would get bored with playing video games and wander in to school to go to the chemistry lab where a [chemist] would show them how to do what they wanted to do. 

A place where people assume you're incapable of just picking up [Dickens] on your own, so they have to force you to read [Oliver Twist] NOW so you'll hate classic literature all your life.

A place where [well-meaning] people destroy creativity.

School is not learning. People hate school, not a^2+b^2=[c^2]. They hate having to wake up early after doing homework late, having to go to a place where they have [no free] will and come home to where it's just reinforced by their parents.

School creates a huge inferiority complex and denies us our status as humans so corporations come in and promise us the chance to feel something intense if we just buy their [snake oil]. A chance to be respected if we buy their shoes, wear their [wristbands], bring our mp3 players around in our $300 backpacks specially designed for the $800 bike [we ride] around so we can complain when we go through a puddle and splash our overpriced jeans made by abused children in India.

[School is hell]. 
	- a place where you are lulled into a false [sense of security], then your life gets so screwed up, you [feel you] [cant take it] any more, you get depressed and experience lots of downs, and some ups.
	- place were you spend first [18 years] [of life] [taking it up the ass]
	- A place where you must deal with work, teachers, events and shithead students all at the same time.  The amount of work you get depends on the teacher you have.  This is the place where students are treated like 3 year olds, you can't point out your [teacher's] flaws, [talk back], or anything like that, even if the teacher gets completely owned.  They come up with some lame excuse/sentence to cover up their wrong, it's sad.  And us students have to sit here and put up with [the teacher's] fucking shit.  Half the classes in school are boring as hell.  Half the stuff you learn in school won't count for fuck when you're older.

It's like being put in a hellhole for 6 in a half hours, once you get outside, you can breathe.

Overall, school just plain sucks.
	- Two words: [Hell hole].

I mean, come on! When in the hell will people just learn that no matter what they say kids don't give a shit? 

School is a place to go if you want to find pot-heads, sluts, incredibly boring lectures that noone listens to anyway, the retarded, [slow-witted] beast known as the "principle", and any other form of shit that makes one's chlildhood less enjoyable.

Hell, my dad was thrown against a wall by a teacher, and got a [concussion].
	- A place you spend your entire life in as a child, and a teenager, hearing the same useless facts [over and over again]. To make matters worse, after [8th grade], you are sent to a place where the stress of school is [amplified]. This place is known as high school
	- A place where teachers look down on you and treat you like [your stupid], even though you are the main reason that they [get paid].
A place you are forced to go, even if you know you will never need more than half the stuff they teach you there.
A place where kids are bullied every day, and not just by the other students, but the teachers also.
A place that basically has no meaning [exept] to make kids depressed.
A place where you go to for seven hours, but you are only learning something knew for about 2hrs.
