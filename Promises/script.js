    a promise is an object that may return a value. After being successfully fulfilled, 
    the value goes from undefined to being populated with data

    A promise can have three possible states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.

    -Pending - Initial state before being resolved or rejected
    -Fulfilled - Successful operation, promise has resolved
    -Rejected - Failed operation, promise has rejected

    After being fulfilled or rejected, a promise is settled.

    when the promise has fulfilled with a value , you will want to be able to access the value .
