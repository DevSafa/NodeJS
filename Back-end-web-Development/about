- a web browser (client)  sent a request to the server where the web page is hosted
-the server will send a respond which contain the web page that we requested
==> this process called (the Request-response model) OR (client-server architecture)


-want to access google maps :
    - write https://www.google.com/maps         in the browser
            ----        ------      ---
            protocol    domaine name  resources
            (http , https)
    - every URL gets an http or https which is for the protocol that will be used for connection.

-domaine name is not the real address of the server that we want to access 
    =>it's a  name that is easy for us to memorize
    - we need a way to convert the domaine name to the real adddress of the server
    =>that's happen throught a DNS (domain name server) => a special server

- when we open up a website , the browser makes a request to the DNS(it will return the server real ip address)
    https::/216.58.211.206:443
    => this happens throught your internet service provider ISP
- the domain is not a real address and DNS will convert it to the real ip address , which the browser can call after sent it back to the browser
    the address will looks like :
        https :    //    216.58.211.206:  443
        -----            --------------   ----
        protocol            Ip address    Port number
        (http or https)                   (Default 443 for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP)
- the port number has nothing to do with google maps resource that we want to access
- the resource will be send over http request 

- once we have  a real address a TCP/Ip SOCKET CONNECTION WILL be established between the browser and the server
    which are now finally connected(browser - server)
- TCP is transmisison control protocol - IP is the internet protocol
    =>together they are communication protocol that defines exactly how data trravels accross the web,
    they are the internet fundamental control system
    -TCP/IP sets the rules about how data moves on the internet

- after the TCP/IP socket connection , an HTTP request is made
- after TCP/IP , HTTP is  another communication protocol.
- a communication protocol that allows two or more parts to communicate.
- HTTP is  a protocol that allows client and web server to communicate by sending request
    and response messages from client to server and back.
- a request message will look something like this :

    GET /maps HTTP/1.1  
    Host: www.google.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    Accept-language: en-User

    <BODY>

- our request now hits the server which will be working on it until it has the website ready 
    to send back 

-s send the response back using an HTTP response , http resonse message looks similar to the request :
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date : Fri, 18 Jan 2021
    Content-type : text/htmlTransfer-Encoding: chunked
    <BODY>
- the response headers is the backend- developper who specify them and sends them back 
    on the response
    -the body of respond should usually contains the html of the website we requested
        or JSON data comming back from an API

- the job of TCP is to break up the requests and responses into thousand of small chunks 
    called packet before they are set
    ->once they get to teh destination , it will reassamble all the packets into 
        the original request or response , so the message arrived to the destination 
        as quick as possible , which will not be possible if we send the web site
        simply as chunk
- the job of the IP protocol is actually sent and route all of this packets throught the internet, it ensure
    that all of them arrived at the destination where it should go using IP addresses on each packet
