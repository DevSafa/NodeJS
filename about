- check the node version installed
    <node -v>
- REPL
    <node>  
        -><"safa".toUpperCase();>

-  window object in the browser = is a reference to our browser window
    window is provided by chrome runtime when javascript is runing chrome application.
    <window>
    <document> "manipulate DOM"
- in node we have global object (the browser doesn't have global object)
    <global>
    <process> "manipulate the node process"

- exit the current node process
    <process.exit()>
-node js is javascript runing on the server not in browser.
    ->this is possible because node js uses the v8 javascript engine to run all the javascript code

-nodejs is able to teach javascript new things by providing c++ bindings to v8.
    ->this allows javascript to do anything that c++ can do , and c++ can access to file system, so js can access the file system through node

- bloking vs Non-blocking I/O

-run a file program.js
    <node program.js>

    - Node.js uses an event-driven , non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient .
    - Node.js' package exosystem , npm , i sthe largest ecosystem of open source librairies in the world .

- when node is installed the npm tool was installed
    https://npmjs.com => search of all sources of prewriting packages
        that you can use inside your application 
        -> you want to vallidate an email you can find a package for that .

----------------------------------------------------------

- node module system => allows us to lead functionalities into our app , and uses interesting things .
    - if you want to read from filesystem
    - connect to a dtaabse 
    - start a web server
=> all of those will require use of modules system 

- load core node modules => included with node installation
- load third party modules written by other developpers 
- load modules that you yourself have created 

- some modules are available globally like console module 


- node js core modules
    https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/


- version of npm 
    <npm -v>
- initialize the npm in our project
    -> this command will create a single configuration file ,
        that we can use to manage all the dependencies from the npm
        website that we want to install .
    <npm init>

-json => javascript object notation
