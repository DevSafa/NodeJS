non-blocking node js app => your application will continue to do 
other things while it's waiting for some long IO process to complete 
=>that make node js great fast and efficient.

synchrounous app means one line runs after the next regardlesss how long each line 
takes to execute

-------------------------------------------
Asynchrounous Node js.

Call Stack is a simple data structure provided by v8 javascript engine : the job 
of the Call Stack is to track the execution of our program and does that by keeping track of all the funtions
that are currently running.

- our script our code will be wrapped in a main function that is created by Node itself , it's 
anonymous function that we refer to it as main


-whenever we call a function the function will be added to the call stack and executed
- when a function finishes by either runing to teh end or returning value, it's get removed from the call stack

-when a function is pushed to teh call stack , it start running

Making HTTP requests

- make http request from your node js application
- this is how your application communicate with outside word
    - get real time weather data in your app ->make http request
    - send an email ->make http request
    - send text message

- make http request to another company server to get some tsak done

-weather api 
    https://weatherstack.com
-firstly make request from tge browser to the weather api
    http://api.weatherstack.com/current?key=value // the format of query string 
    http://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key=93a509590a634d41eec32553a0695764&query=32.235967,-7.946685

--------------------------
npm request module :
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/request
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-request 
    postman request is a nice alternative to request npm module

- install npm module in our project , so we can make a request from our node application
- initialize weather app as an npm project 
    <npm init -y > => generate package.json file
- install the module
    <npm i request@2.88.0> =>don't use g flag because it's a module that i want to use inside myscript , not globally
-chrome extension json formatter

adding another query parameter to specify units 
http://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key=93a509590a634d41eec32553a0695764&query=32.235967,-7.946685&units=f

------------------------------------
 node app.js search --term={home,school,hello}
 ---------------------------------
 //use another http apis in weather application 
//Geocoding service
//Geocoding is the process of taking an address and convert iit into latitude and longitude coordinate pair
//once we have those coordinates , we will be able to pass them off to the weatherstack api to get the weather info
//for that location.

//user will provide address => convert it to lat/Long -> then use the weatherstack to get the weather
//search services = >forward geocoding 
//end-point = mapbox.places(main one)
//search-term
