other things while it's waiting for some long IO process to complete 
=>that make node js great fast and efficient.

Call Stack is a simple data structure provided by v8 javascript engine : the job 
of the Call Stack is to track the execution of our program and does that by keeping track of all the funtions
that are currently running.

- our script our code will be wrapped in a main function that is created by Node itself , it's 
anonymous function that we refer to it as main


-whenever we call a function the function will be added to the call stack and executed
- when a function finishes by either runing to teh end or returning value, it's get removed from the call stack

-when a function is pushed to teh call stack , it start running
