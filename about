-  window object in the browser = is a reference to our browser window
    window is provided by chrome runtime when javascript is runing chrome application.
    <window>
    <document> "manipulate DOM"
- in node we have global object (the browser doesn't have global object)
    <global>
    <process> "manipulate the node process"

- exit the current node process
    <process.exit()>
-node js is javascript runing on the server not in browser.
    ->this is possible because node js uses the v8 javascript engine to run all the javascript code

-nodejs is able to teach javascript new things by providing c++ bindings to v8.
    ->this allows javascript to do anything that c++ can do , and c++ can access to file system, so js can access the file system through node

- bloking vs Non-blocking I/O

-run a file program.js
    <node program.js>

    - Node.js uses an event-driven , non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient .
    - Node.js' package exosystem , npm , i sthe largest ecosystem of open source librairies in the world .

- when node is installed the npm tool was installed
    https://npmjs.com => search of all sources of prewriting packages
        that you can use inside your application 
        -> you want to vallidate an email you can find a package for that .
