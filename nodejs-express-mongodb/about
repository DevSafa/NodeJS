- Node is the runtime that allows us to write all of our server-side tasks 
    like business logic, data persistence, and security â€” in JavaScript.
    It also adds functionalities that normal browser JavaScript doesn't have, 
    like giving you access to the local filesystem, for example.

- Express, simply put, is a framework that sits on top of Node, and makes Node servers 
    much easier to build and maintain

---------------------------------
- to start the server use : node server.js / node server
- use a browser window to navigate to http://localhost:3000
- npm install -g nodemon

- Now, instead of using  node server  to spin up your server, you can use  
- nodemon server , which will watch your files for changes and restart the server, 
    making sure it is always up to date

----------------------------------
- Writing web servers in pure Node, while possible, is time-consuming and painstaking, 
    as we have to manually parse every incoming request, for example. Using the Express 
    framework makes these tasks much simpler, allowing us to build out our APIs in half 
    the time.
- To add Express to your project, run the following :
    npm install --save express
