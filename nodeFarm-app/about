what is an API
-----
- basically an API is a service from which we can request some data
- in our case the data that user want to request is the data about 
    the product we are offering in this node farm.

JSON
---
is a very simple text format that looks a lot like javascript object
- the data inside  data.json is our API sent to teh client when requested 
--------- 

in node-js every single file is treated like a module

--------------------
-the node package manager is  a command line interface app that automatically comes included with node js.
-we use it to install and manage open source packages
-this packages usually comes from the package repository taht is also npm
-in npmjs.com you can find all the packages ,modules that are included in npm repository
-npm is both the command line interface that we use to manage packages and also the repository
-npm is the largest software registry in the world , no matter what language we're talking about
- the command line interface comes preinstalled with node js
-express is the node framework that we will use .

- npm is a software thatw e basically used to manage the third party open source packages taht we choose to include and to use in our project

-whenever we start a new project usually we start with <npm init> <npm init -y> 
    =>it will create a apackage.json file , which kind of configuration file of our project, when all the data about the project is stored.
-when creating this file , there is a lot of stuff we can add to this file (package.json), when installing packages it will be registered in package.json , so we can keep track of packages we are using



---------------------------------------------
two types of packages that we can install with npm :
    -dependencies : -are packages that contains some code that we will include in our code 
                    -code upon on which we build our application.
                    -that's why we call them dependencies because our project depends on them to work correctly
                    - for example express which is the node framework , that will be our dependency
                    - install a simple dependency : <npm install slugify> (--save is no longer necessary )
    -developement dependencies : these are tools for developpement : like code bundler , webpack , debuger tool , test tool
                                - these are developpement dependencies , they are not needed for our code ,
                                - our code not depend on them.
                                <npm install nodemon --save-dev> => it will add an entry to the package.json in the dev dependencies
                                <npm run devserver>
-node modules : created by npm has all dependencies for this project
-two types for installing these packages ; locally or globally
-global install will be available everywhere
    <npm i nodemon -g>

- if we didn't install node globally , how we use the devdependencies locally? 
=>we can't simply run it from the command line because the local  dependencies don't work like that
=> so what we can do is to specify an npm script
    run an npm script <npm run start> <npm start>
    - start is a default one for developement , so we don't need to run <npm run start> <npm start>
