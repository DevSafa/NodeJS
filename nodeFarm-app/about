what is an API
-----
- basically an API is a service from which we can request some data
- in our case the data that user want to request is the data about 
    the product we are offering in this node farm.

JSON

is a very simple text format that looks a lot like javascript object
- the data inside  data.json is our API sent to teh client when requested
